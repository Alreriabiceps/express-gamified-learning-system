## Detailed Verification

### Test Case 53: Test Availability âœ…

**Purpose**: To test only active tests are available
**Implementation**:

- Backend filters schedules by `isActive` status
- Frontend dropdowns only show active schedules
- Database indexes optimize query performance

### Test Case 54: Solo Test Execution âœ…

**Purpose**: To test individual test taking process
**Implementation**:

- Students can select subject and week
- Questions are retrieved from database
- Answers are tracked and scored
- Results are saved to TestResult model

### Test Case 55: Test Timer âœ…

**Purpose**: To test timer functionality
**Implementation**:

- 15-minute timer (900 seconds) implemented in WeeklyTest.jsx
- Auto-submit when timer expires
- Warning at 1 minute remaining
- Visual countdown display

### Test Case 56: Test Completion Lock âœ…

### Test Case 57: Scoring System âœ…

**Purpose**: To test correct score calculation and point allocation
**Implementation**:

- Backend scoring logic in `testResultController.js`

### Test Case 59: Team Test Eligibility âœ…

**Purpose**: To test team test eligibility rules
**Implementation**:

- Checks UserWeeklyAttempt for existing attempts
- Prevents team test if solo test completed
- Prevents solo test if team test completed
- Returns INELIGIBLE error with blocked users
